# NRZ (S) Modulation Project Readme

## Introduction

Welcome to the NRZ (S) Modulation Project! This project explores an enhanced version of the Non-Return to Zero (NRZ) signaling scheme known as NRZ (S). The aim is to address the limitations of conventional NRZ modulation in digital communication systems. This readme provides an overview of the project's objectives, methodology, and key findings.

## Project Scope

This project focuses on the practical implementation of NRZ (S) modulation, encompassing both encoding and decoding processes. The project utilizes two powerful tools: Proteus for signal generation and visualization, and MATLAB for signal processing and decoding.

## Encoding Process

### Proteus Simulation

The encoding process begins with the generation of the NRZ (S) signal using Proteus simulation. Proteus provides a comprehensive platform to simulate and visualize the encoded signal. This allows for the evaluation of signal quality and performance.

### MATLAB

MATLAB is employed to further analyze and refine the encoded signal. The report outlines a step-by-step procedure for encoding the signal using MATLAB.

## Decoding Process

The project demonstrates how to recover the original binary data from the NRZ (S) signal using the same two techniques used in encoding. Various decoding techniques are explored, highlighting their effectiveness and trade-offs.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

- **Signal Quality Assessment:** Evaluate the quality and performance of the NRZ (S) signal using Proteus simulation.

- **Signal Processing:** Utilize MATLAB for signal processing to facilitate the decoding of the encoded signal.

- **Binary Data Recovery:** Demonstrate how to recover the original binary data from the NRZ (S) signal.

## Contributions

This project aims to contribute to the practical utilization of NRZ (S) modulation techniques. By leveraging Proteus simulation and MATLAB decoding, researchers can effectively evaluate signal quality and recover the original binary data. These insights have the potential to enhance data transmission rates and system performance in modern digital communication systems.
